# first-fit
## About the project
this project is an implementation of first fit algorithm 
by taking processes and memory sizes and assign each process to the first memory fits it
then output the remaining in each memory

## output must be like that
memory size      process added   remain
100              0               100
500              212             288
200              112             88
300              0               300
600              417             183
